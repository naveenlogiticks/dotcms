quotes

attributed to frank nothaft, vice president and chief economist, freddie mac.

"recent economic data releases of less consumer spending and a contraction in the 

manufacturing industry drove long-term treasury bond yields lower over the week and 

allowed fixed mortgage rates to hit new all-time record lows. growth in personal 

expenditures was revised downward to an annualized rate of 2.5 percent in the final 

gdp estimates for the first quarter of the year. in addition, monthly consumer spending 

in april was revised from a 0.3 percent gain to 0.1 percent and was unchanged in may. 

finally, the institute for supply management reported that manufacturing shrank in 

june, the first decline since july 2009."
